		<div class="twocol"><p>Hearse Pileup is the sound of rock 'n' roll for the undead. As the earth becomes a ticking timebomb of war, cataclysmic environmental disaster and gross over consumption there is only one message to our music:</p>
<p><strong>SOMETHING IS VERY, VERY WRONG</strong></p>
<p>Spitting fire and pissing vinegar, Hearse Pileup are part nostalgic throwback to 70's/80's stoner/punk rock and part anarchic doomsayers. Heavily influenced by the likes of Motorhead, Queens of the Stone Age, Iggy pop and Black Sabbath, Hearse Pileup bring balls-to-the-wall hard Rock 'n' Roll back into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Hearse Pileup have had many London-based gigs and have just finished recording their soon to be released EP at Dropout studio. They have just released a short free-to-download live album on bandcamp, and for the most recent news you can subscribe to their newsletter.</p></div>
